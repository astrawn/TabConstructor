# TabConstructor
I often times like to try to figure out songs by ear on guitar and then write them down, but constructing a tab by hand can be a pain. So, I have come up with a solution that will make this easier. This tab constructor will allow you to input pieces automically that would normally be sort of a nuisance to type out. The constructor will also have an automatic 'copy-to-clipboard' function as well as a download function that allows you to download your tab as a .txt file.
